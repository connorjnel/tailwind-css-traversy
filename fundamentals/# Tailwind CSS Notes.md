# Tailwind CSS Notes

## What is Tailwind

- Low level utility class framework.
- Bootstrap uses classes that correlate to components, tailwind correlates to utility classes
- Bootstrap sites look very similar, tailwind a bit more unique
- Tailwind is customizable with directives and functions
- Tailwind has conditional naming for classes ie responsive, pseudo states

## Basic Tailwind setup

- Tailwind CSS Intellisense for VSCODE
- Using CDN is fine for playing or testing, for PROD install properly using NPM

## Fundamentals

- Very nice, a whole lot of classes on each element but works extremely well, logical naming, colors especially very well thought out with variable color from 50 - 950
- Black and white have no shades, other colors need to have a num value otherwise default to black
- To have intellisense work for tailwind need to have tailwind installed and tailwind config file setup
